# Prework - *IOS_Prework*

Submitted by: **Kelvin Chen**

**IOS_PreWork** is an app that... [TODO] 
-it changes the background color once the button is clicked on. It should
also contain a bit of information about me which different font styles for
the text.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [Y] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [Y] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1) Discord:
    -Customizable UI (can change pfp, light and dark mode, and other things
    to change avatar icon)
    -User friendly (the interface is simple and easy to use)
    
2) Imessage:
    -Very simple to use
    -Able to edit messages easily
    
3) Instagram:
    -Simple design (layout is simple and easy to follow)
    -Can easily send messages to different people through scrolling
    
    
-One app I would like to build would blend discord and instgram. I would like
to create an app where it is easy for people or friends to come together and chat
while also be able to send reels to each other. For that, I would have consider heavily
on how to design a friendly user inferace. This is so that it is easy to understand and use, 
so that users won't get confused about how to send reels and message each other while also
trying to figure out how to join a voice channel with each other. I would like to be also 
allow a lot of customizability similar to discord. This app that I would like to build
would hopefully be a perfect mix between discord and instagram.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

-When I was trying to add more to the app, I was trying to figure out
how to add a button that would be able to change the text color. It is supposed to function
similarly to the button that changes the background color on click. I thought about having
it use the same changeColor function as the changeBackgroundColor() function to get
the color and use that to set the text color. However, after a while of experimenting and 
testing, I was unable to figure how exactly to get that to be implemented. Instead, I just
played around with the font styles and text.
